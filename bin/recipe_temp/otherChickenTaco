>Preheat oven to 400°F. Spray a 9×13 baking dish with nonstick spray
>Heat olive oil over medium heat in a medium skillet.
>Add onion to skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the onion is translucent and fragrant.
>Stir in the chicken, taco seasoning, tomatoes (FULLY DRAINED), and green chiles (FULLY  DRAINED) *see note. Stir to combine fully. Reduce to simmer and allow to cook for 5-8 minutes.
>Place the taco shells in the baking dish, standing up. I was able to fit 10 taco shells in the dish by adding 2 on each side.
>Bake the taco shells for 5 minutes by themselves to allow them to crisp up. Remove from the oven.
>Spoon 1 tablespoon of beans into the bottom of each taco shell. Top with the chicken mixture, almost to the top of each shell.
>Sprinkle each shell generously with shredded cheese, the more the better!
>Bake for 7-10 minutes or until cheese is fully melted and the edges of the shells are browned.
>Remove from the oven and top with your favorite items such as jalapenos, sour cream, cilantro, and salsa.
