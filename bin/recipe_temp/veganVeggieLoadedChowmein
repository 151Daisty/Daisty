>Follow the package instructions to warm and separate the yakisoba noodles.
>In a medium bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, dark soy sauce (if using), garlic, brown sugar, water, rice vinegar, and sriracha. Set aside.
>Heat the sesame (or vegetable) oil in a wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms in a single layer and saute for 90 seconds per side, until browned. Remove from skillet and set aside.
>Add the broccoli and carrots to the pan along with 1/4 cup of water. Cover the pan, turn the heat down to medium, and let the vegetables steam for 2 minutes. Add the cabbage and scallions and stir-fry for 1 minute. Return the mushrooms to the pan along with the prepared noodles. Toss well.
>Pour the whisked sauce into the pan and toss the noodles to coat. Let the sauce come to a boil before turning the heat off. Serve hot, garnished with sesame seeds (if desired).
